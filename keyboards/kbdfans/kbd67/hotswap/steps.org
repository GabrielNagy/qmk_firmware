* Steps to flash firmware
  1. Use [[https://config.qmk.fm/#/kbdfans/kbd67/hotswap/LAYOUT][QMK Configurator]] to generate keymap
     - Upload existing keymap.json if applicable
  2. Download keymap and place it under =keymaps/keymap/=
  3. Compile downloaded keymap (not applicable if already got hex file)
     : make kbd67/hotswap:keymap:dfu
  4. Put keyboard in DFU mode (unplug then plug in while holding ESC, it should be detected and disconnected shortly after)
  5. Firmware should automatically flash (previous command checks every 5 seconds for devices)
  6. Profit!
